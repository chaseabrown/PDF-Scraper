# Python-PDF_Scraper
Got tired of having to search through PDFs to figure out which class to take, so I built this to put it all into a csv

*Built to make my life easier, so not optimized for distribution*

Steps:
1. Run siteScraper.py - This will download all of the PDFs
2. Run parsePDFData.py - This will create csv from PDFs
